# Donkey Kong‑Style Mini‑Game (HTML/CSS/JS)

This repository contains a simple browser‑based mini‑game inspired by the classic
Donkey Kong arcade title. The goal was to build an interactive demo using core
web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) as part of a CSS mini‑project.

## 🧩 Project Structure

```
index.html        ← main HTML document
style.css         ← game and layout styling
logic.js          ← game logic and interactivity
imgs/             ← image assets (player, barrels, platforms, etc.)
README.md         ← this file
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hhtml-donkey-kong-main.git
   cd hhtml-donkey-kong-main
   ```

2. **Open in a browser**
   - Double-click `index.html`, or
   - Run a simple HTTP server (recommended for proper asset loading):
     ```bash
     # Python 3
     python -m http.server 8000
     # then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser
     ```

3. **Play the game**
   - Use the arrow keys (or on‑screen controls) to move the player character.
   - Avoid barrels and reach the top of the level to win.
